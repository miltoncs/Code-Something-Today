# Sqlite API Wrapper

Some Sqlite client libraries only provide a way to run raw sql strings to query a database. We want to build queries using methods/functions/objects.

## TODO List

### Phase 1 - Basic API

- Add DB creation call
- Implement CREATE (creating tables) with different types of primary keys
- Implement INSERT and SELECT statements


### Phase 2 - Join

- Add the ability to join tables in queries

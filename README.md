# Code-Something-Today

A list of small-scale coding project ideas to introduce the avid developer to specific tools/languages/algorithms/etc. The idea is not to create something novel and production-hardened, but to try something out by doing something more than just "Hello, World."

Project ideas are organized by name of the primary tool or toolchain being learned.
